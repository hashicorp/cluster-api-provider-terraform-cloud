# Kubernetes Cluster API Provider for Terraform Cloud

> **Warning**
> Please note that this is a technical preview and is for experimental purposes only 

Kubernetes-native declarative infrastructure using Terraform Cloud.

## What is the Cluster API Provider for Terraform Cloud?

The [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-apiterra) project brings declarative Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management. This provider allows you to create [Terraform Modules](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules) to implement Cluster API's contracts and run them in [Terraform Cloud](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) to provision the infrastructure using Kubernetes as your source of truth.  

## Supported Cluster API contracts

The provider currently implements the contracts that allow the infrastructure for managed clusters and machine pools to be provisioned. 

- [Cluster](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/developer/architecture/controllers/cluster.html) and [Control Plane](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/developer/architecture/controllers/control-plane.html) are fulfilled by TFCManagedControlPlane  
- [MachinePool](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/developer/architecture/controllers/machine-pool.html) is fulfilled by TFCManagedMachinePool 


## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/cluster-api-provider-terraform-cloud:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/cluster-api-provider-terraform-cloud:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
